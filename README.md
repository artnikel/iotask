## Logging

The application uses structured logging to track important events and errors. Logs are written to a file configured in the application settings. There are two main loggers:

- **Info logger**: Records informational messages about normal operations.
- **Error logger**: Records errors and warnings to help diagnose issues.

The log file `app.log` is created immediately after the server starts, located in the `logs` directory by default.
